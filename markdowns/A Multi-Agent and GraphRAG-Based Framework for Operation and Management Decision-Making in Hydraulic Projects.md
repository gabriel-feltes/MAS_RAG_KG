## Abstract

Inspection of hydraulic projects is a core management task to ensure the safe and stable operation of major infrastructure. The current traditional inspection model has significant shortcomings, such as high reliance on manual labor, low accuracy in identifying potential risks, and insufficient dynamic decision-making capabilities. This paper innovatively constructs  a  multi-agent  collaborative  intelligent  decision-making  framework  that  integrates large  language  models  (LLMs)  and  graph  retrieval-augmented  generation  (Graph  RAG) technologies.  Through  a  modular  architecture  encompassing  perception,  cognition,  and decision,  the  framework  achieves  full-process  automated  inspection. The  study  employs multi-source inspection data from the past three years to construct a multimodal dataset. Domain-adaptive  fine-tuning  enhances  the  F1  scores  of  the  multimodal  large  model  in equipment recognition and defect detection by 7.2% and 6.9%, respectively. Furthermore, a  dynamic  knowledge  graph  system  based  on  Graph  RAG  is  established.  Knowledge injection  techniques  compensate  for  gaps  in  domain-specific  knowledge,  while  entityrelation  reasoning  mechanisms effectively mitigate model hallucination phenomena. Experimental results demonstrate that the hydraulic engineering inspection reports generated by  this  method,  evaluated  by  both  experts  and  operations  personnel,  accurately  reflect professional  knowledge  and  technical  depth  in  the  field  of  hydraulic  engineering  maintenance. This research provides a new technical paradigm with strong explainability and high  reliability  for  the  intelligent  operation  and  maintenance  of  hydraulic  engineering infrastructure, offering significant engineering application value to promote digital transformation within the industry.

## 1  Introduction

The inspection of hydraulic engineering projects is a fundamental process to ensure the safe and stable operation of infrastructure, with its effectiveness playing a crucial role in the  quality  of  lifecycle  management.  However,  conventional  inspection  approaches  still rely  heavily  on  manual  on-site  surveys,  where  variations  in  inspectors'  expertise  often result in inconsistent identification of potential hazards and considerable human-induced uncertainty. Although modern monitoring technologies-such as unmanned aerial vehicles (Sibanda et al. 2021), satellites (Golestani et al. 2024), and remote sensing (Baronian et al. 2024 ; Faramarzzadeh et al. 2023 )-have significantly improved the efficiency of data acquisition, the subsequent analysis and decision-making stages still depend largely on human interpretation. This dependency restricts the level of automation and intelligence in current inspection workflows. Moreover, existing intelligent inspection systems often exhibit limited capabilities in cross-modal data fusion and domain-specific knowledge reasoning, making them inadequate for supporting dynamic decision-making under complex operational conditions. As a result, traditional inspection methods continue to face bottlenecks in key areas such as manual dependency, risk detection accuracy, and adaptive responsiveness. To address these limitations, it is imperative to develop system-level upgrades by integrating intelligent frameworks, cross-modal data processing techniques, and automated decisionmaking mechanisms into hydraulic inspection processes.

The development of agent technology provides a new pathway to address the above challenges. Meng (2024) proposed a leadership model for ecological water resource gover -nance based on evolutionary game theory and multi-agent collaboration, which reveals the interactions and equilibrium pathways among stakeholders in controlling water pollution and addressing resource scarcity. Bahrami et al. (2023 ) developed an agent-based system integrating  Conditional  Value-at-Risk  optimization  and  the  NSGA-II  evolutionary  algorithm to simulate the resource allocation behavior of various stakeholders under uncertainty, achieving a coordinated optimization of fairness and risk minimization. Motlaghzadeh et al. (2023 )  introduced  a  hierarchical  multi-agent  decision-making  framework  incorporating game theory to support the evaluation and optimization of water and environmental management scenarios under climate change. Aydin and Keleş (2021) further combined multi-agent systems with optimal planning and control models to develop a multi-agent dispatching system tailored for freshwater supply management in metropolitan areas. However, despite demonstrating strong collaborative decision-making capabilities in specific scenarios, these multi-agent systems generally rely on predefined rules or fixed game strategies, which limit their adaptability to complex and dynamic environments, thereby restricting their practical application in the field of hydraulic engineering.

In recent years, breakthroughs in LLMs (Chang et al. 2024) have created pivotal oppor -tunities for advancing agent capabilities. By endowing agents with semantic understanding and dynamic reasoning abilities through LLMs, the flexibility and effectiveness of multiagent collaboration can be significantly enhanced. LLMs are deep learning-based systems trained on massive datasets and equipped with large-scale parameter architectures, enabling reasoning and predictive performance that approaches human-level intelligence (Guo et al. 2024 ). This capability continues to improve as research in the field progresses (Wang et al. 2024 ).  Consequently,  LLM-based  decision-making  and  planning  agent  systems  are  rapidly  evolving  (Ren  et  al. 2024 ;  Wang  et  al. 2025 ).  Multi-agent  frameworks  empowered

by LLMs enable collaborative agents to operate within shared environments, facilitating the execution of complex and context-aware tasks.Altermatt et al. ( 2025) investigated the performance of single-agent and multi-agent language models in answering questions from EUNACOM, the Chilean national medical licensing exam. Qian et al. ( 2024) simulates the software development lifecycle by dividing the process into design, coding, testing, and documentation phases,  assigning  different  prompts  and  roles  to  agents  to  mimic  human collaboration and achieve consensus. Hong et al. (2023 )  integrates structured workflows into an LLM-based multi-agent programming framework to facilitate effective coordination across different agent roles. Similarly, Li et al. ( 2023) introduces an innovative collaborative agent framework that enables agents to autonomously complete tasks with minimal human intervention.

A review of the existing literature on multi-agent systems reveals that traditional multiagent frameworks predominantly rely on predefined rules or shallow models to construct coordination strategies. These approaches generally lack the ability to comprehend highlevel semantics and exhibit limited adaptability to dynamic and complex tasks. Meanwhile, with the continuous advancements in LLMs in general reasoning, natural language under -standing, and complex task planning, LLM-based agent systems have demonstrated remarkable performance across various domains-especially in multi-agent collaboration. However, when applied to highly specialized and structurally complex tasks such as the operation and maintenance of hydraulic engineering projects, current LLM-enhanced multi-agent systems still face several critical challenges. On one hand, they exhibit insufficient deep semantic understanding of hydraulic entities and their interrelationships, and lack knowledge mod -eling mechanisms that integrate contextual domain logic. This often leads to suboptimal accuracy in hazard identification and risk diagnosis. On the other hand, due to inadequate incorporation  of  domain-specific  knowledge,  such  systems  are  prone  to  "hallucination" effects,  significantly increasing the risk of misjudgments during critical decision-making processes.  Furthermore,  current  multi-agent  frameworks  generally  lack  mechanisms  for dynamic  knowledge  updating  and  evolution,  rendering  them  ineffective  in  adapting  to emerging or unforeseen defects in hydraulic infrastructure maintenance.

To address the aforementioned challenges, this study proposes an intelligent decisionmaking framework that integrates multi-agent systems with knowledge-enhanced mechanisms to tackle key issues in hydraulic operation and maintenance, including low accuracy in hazard identification, limited dynamic decision-making capabilities, and high dependence on manual inspection. The proposed framework aims to improve the intelligence, auton -omy, and knowledge-driven capabilities of hydraulic inspection tasks. The main research contributions and innovations are as follows:

(1) To improve the accuracy of hazard identification, this work fine-tunes a multimodal large language model using a domain-adaptive training set constructed from three years of multisource  inspection  data. This  enhances  the  model's  ability  to  recognize  engineering risks more precisely.

(2) To address model hallucinations caused by insufficient domain knowledge and the lack of dynamic knowledge updating in changing environments, a knowledge enhancement approach is designed. By constructing scene-specific knowledge graphs based on unstructured sources such as historical inspection reports, equipment operation records, and tech -nical manuals from the South-to-North Water Diversion Project, the framework enhances

1 3

LLM performance through domain knowledge injection. This not only mitigates hallucina -tion effects but also improves adaptability to emerging infrastructure maintenance issues.

(3) A  hierarchical  multi-agent  collaboration  framework  is  proposed,  grounded  in  the business logic of hydraulic inspection scenarios and the defined functional roles of agents. The framework comprises three layers: the perception layer, the cognition layer, and the decision  layer,  enabling  structured  coordination  across  heterogeneous  agents.The  modu -lar decoupled design allows for flexible adaptation to various types of hydraulic projects and other infrastructure systems. Users can customize workflows and datasets according to specific scenarios, enabling rapid deployment and improving generalization in dynamic environments.

## 2  Methodology

## 2.1  Multi-Agent Collaborative Decision-making Framework

The  multi-agent  system  framework  proposed  in  this  study  is  designed  according  to  the business  logic  of  hydraulic  inspection  tasks  and  consists  of  multiple  specialized  agents. Among these, the data collection agent, data processing agent, maintenance plan execution agent, inspection report authoring agent, and inspection report archiving agent are classified as simple reflex agents. In contrast, the defect identification agent, risk assessment agent, maintenance plan generation agent, and maintenance plan approval agent are categorized as learning agents (Ye et al. 2025 ; Russell and Norvig 2021 ). These agents collaborate through a  shared  memory structure and utilize message-passing mechanisms to achieve modular execution  and  closed-loop  decision-making. The  system  follows  a  task-chain  paradigm, where downstream agents depend on the outputs of upstream tasks, enabling automated workflow integration and intelligent feedback. This modular collaboration mechanism significantly enhances the automation level and flexibility of complex inspection processes. To clarify system functionality and enable hierarchical management, the agents are organized into three functional layers: perception, cognition, and decision-making. These layers cover the entire intelligent workflow from data acquisition to maintenance validation. Figure 1 illustrates the systemic implementation of this three-layer architecture and the collaboration paths among modules.

Perception Layer(Fig. 1\_I): A multi-modal perception agent group is deployed at this layer to acquire real-time raw data from hydraulic engineering operations. Through an internet of things sensor network, various engineering parameters are continuously collected to monitor structural changes in real time. Simultaneously, UAV inspection images, satellite remote sensing data, and textual records are integrated to enrich the system's knowledge of operational risks. A previously developed multimodal large language model is employed to achieve spatial and temporal alignment of multi-source data. This layer consists of the data collection agent, data processing agent, and defect identification agent. The data collection agent is responsible for acquiring raw multimodal data from multiple sources, including drones, remote sensing imagery, Internet of Things sensors, and manual inputs. The data processing agent performs preprocessing on the collected data, which includes tasks such as image cleaning, video frame extraction, and text normalization. The defect identification

agent utilizes a domain-adapted multimodal large language model to detect defects in equipment and engineering structures.

Cognition Layer(Fig. 1\_II): A dual knowledge enhancement mechanism is implemented at this layer. (1) Domain-adaptive fine-tuning strategy. By aligning multimodal representations and employing prompt fine-tuning strategies, the multimodal LLM is optimized using multimodal inspection data. This improves accuracy in key tasks such as defect identification in the operation and management of the South-to-North Water Diversion Project. (2) GraphRAG-based dynamic knowledge base. By integrating unstructured knowledge such as historical inspection reports, equipment operation records, and technical manuals from the South-to-North Water Diversion Project, knowledge graphs are constructed for different scenarios. Vector-based retrieval techniques extract highly relevant knowledge from the knowledge graph, which is then combined with role-specific prompt templates to generate precise responses. This mitigates LLM hallucinations and enhances system adaptability to new engineering maintenance defects through continuous knowledge updates.

Decision Layer(Fig. 1\_III): A divide-and-conquer strategy is adopted to decompose the inspection process into a sequence of logically related, modular sub-tasks. Each module operates independently, enabling process decoupling (Zhang et al. 2023 ). A multi-stage task chain is designed to enable closed-loop management decisions, comprising risk assessment, maintenance plan generation, maintenance plan approval, maintenance execution, and effectiveness verification.First, The risk assessment agent interacts with the dynamic knowledge base using equipment and defect information to determine the corresponding risk levels

and  categories.  Based  on  the  assessment  results,  the  maintenance  plan  generation  agent formulates a maintenance plan pending validation by leveraging a domain-adapted finetuned model combined with GraphRAG dynamic knowledge base prompts. Subsequently, the maintenance plan approval agent performs automated evaluation of the plan content through  an  embedded  scoring  rubric  integrated  with  LLM  techniques. The  maintenance plan execution agent then automatically sends notification emails to repair technician to initiate the implementation of the approved plan. Upon successful execution, a self-validation mechanism is triggered, utilizing a multimodal large language model to verify the maintenance effectiveness. The inspection report authoring agent employs a structured report template, as shown in Eq. 1, where the final decision output is formalized as:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

where E denotes the equipment code, D describes the defect, C ∈ { Structural Safety , Operational Status , Quality Defects , Management Violations } specifies the category of the issue, G ∈ [ I , IV ] represents the risk level, and M encompasses the maintenance plan, including resource constraints and estimated timelines.

Finally, the inspection report archiving agent automatically stores the finalized inspection report into a MySQL database.

## 2.2  Domain-Adaptive Fine-Tuning

## 2.2.1  Multimodal Fine-Tuning Strategy

To address the lack of domain knowledge in the LLaVA (Liu et al. 2023) model, this study proposes an optimized framework based on multimodal data construction and parameterefficient fine-tuning, as illustrated in Fig. 2 . First, engineering images and text are extracted from  hydraulic  engineering  operation  and  maintenance  documents.  A  Python  script  is used to generate multi-turn dialogue data annotated with engineering maintenance defects (Fig. 2 \_I). The dataset is then filtered for noise using ChatGLM (GLM et al. 2024) and vali -dated by domain experts to form a high-quality, image-text-aligned corpus.

Based  on  this  corpus,  Low-Rank Adaptation  (LoRA)  (Hu  et  al. 2022)  is  applied  for parameter-efficient fine-tuning. To prevent catastrophic forgetting of general knowledge, the  original  model  parameters  are  frozen  (Fig. 2\_II),  and  trainable  matrices  are  injected

Fig. 2 The LLaVA fine-tuning framework includes: (I) construction of image-text alignment datasets; (II) freezing of the Vision Tower; (III) injection of LoRA modules into the multimodal projector layers; and (IV) injection of LoRA modules into the attention layers of the LLM, enabling effective adaptation to multimodal tasks

only into the mutilmodalprojector layer (Fig. 2 \_III) and the attention layer (Fig. 2 \_IV). A progressive learning rate scheduler and dynamic batch processing strategy are employed to efficiently integrate domain knowledge while preserving the model's general capabilities.

The LLaVA model utilizes CLIP (Radford et al. 2021 ) as the visual encoder V ( · ) to pro -cess engineering images with a resolution of 1024 × 683 . The extracted visual features are then transformed via a learnable projection matrix. For the instruction text X q , an embed -ding layer encodes the input, which is concatenated and fused with the visual features before being  fed  into  the  language  model f φ ( · ) to  generate  the  final  response X a ,as  shown  in Eq. 2.:

## 2.2.2  Prompt Strategy Fine-Tuning

To address the complexity of hydraulic engineering inspection tasks, this study designs a cognition-enhancing mechanism based on multi-role collaboration (Wang et al. 2023) for fine-tuning LLMs, using structured prompt templates to enable process-driven execution, as illustrated in Fig. 3.

This mechanism integrates few-shot learning (Brown et al. 2020) and decomposes the inspection  workflow  into  modular  execution  stages.  Each  stage  corresponds  to  specific skills assigned to distinct roles, as detailed in Table 1 .

The hydraulic engineering prompt template adopts a two-tier instruction architecture:(1) Role-specific sub-instructions define operational standards (e.g., "As an inspector, please analyze  the  distribution  characteristics  of  concrete  cracks  in  the  image.").  (2)  Dynamic examples  construct  knowledge  anchors. The  template  incorporates  parameterized  placeholders (e.g., Role Name, Specific Task Content) to support automated adaptation. By cou-

pling role-based expertise with process nodes, the model can collaboratively invoke multiple expert capabilities, significantly enhancing reasoning robustness in complex scenarios.

## 2.3  GraphRAG-based Dynamic Knowledge Base Construction

Inspection tasks involve multimodal data resources, including dynamic monitoring infor -mation, equipment operation records, maintenance history documents, and technical speci -fication manuals. These data sources contain both structured data collected from real-time sensors and a large volume of unstructured textual data. Traditional data analysis methods face significant limitations in information integration and knowledge extraction, given the increasing  volume  and  complexity  of  data  relationships.  While  LLMs  excel  in  generaldomain  text  processing,  they  inherently  lack  domain  sensitivity  and  dynamic  updating mechanisms, which creates technical bottlenecks when generating accurate inspection deci -sion recommendations. To address these challenges, this study proposes a GraphRAG-based domain knowledge enhancement method, which consists of two key components: operation and maintenance knowledge graph construction and hierarchical retrieval mechanism.

## 2.3.1  Operation and Maintenance Knowledge Graph Construction

This study collected unstructured textual data from historical inspection reports, equipment operation records, and technical specification manuals related to the South-to-North Water Diversion  Project. After  a  series  of  text  preprocessing  steps,  a  standardized  corpus  was constructed, covering 12 categories of hydraulic engineering objects, such as sluice gates and pumping stations. With the assistance of domain experts in hydraulic engineering, a conceptual model for the operation and maintenance knowledge graph was developed. This model comprises 10 types of entities (e.g., 'organization', 'site', and 'component') and 9 types of relationships (e.g., 'manages', 'contains', and 'is composed of'), as defined and illustrated in Fig. 4.

Figure 5 presents the technical workflow for constructing a knowledge graph and generating community reports to support operation and maintenance in hydraulic projects. As shown in Fig. 5 (I), standardized corpora obtained from processed text sources are initially segmented into discrete text blocks. Figure 5(II)  illustrates  the  extraction  of  entities  and semantic relations. This process adopts a two-stage parsing strategy based on LLMs, guided by an expert-defined conceptual schema and prompt engineering. An iterative optimization mechanism is introduced to  regulate  the  coverage  and  consistency  of  extracted  entities, ensuring convergence toward a predefined completeness threshold. Figure 5(III) depicts the knowledge graph construction phase. In this stage, the extracted entities and relations are structured into a graph-based representation, where nodes denote domain-specific entities and edges encode semantic or functional relationships. Graph consistency and connectivity are validated through rule-based constraints and ontology alignment to ensure semantic integrity and usability in downstream tasks. Finally, Fig. 5(IV) describes the community generation  and  summarization  phase.  Using  the  Leiden  community  detection  algorithm, graph nodes are partitioned into high-cohesion clusters to facilitate modularized management. Each community is further enriched with an automatically generated summary via LLMs and prompt engineering, providing a concise representation of the global semantic landscape.

## 2.3.2  Hierarchical Retrieval Mechanism

The user query retrieval mechanism consists of two components: local query and global query. As shown in Fig. 6.

Local Query: The embedding model converts user input into vector representations and performs an initial match using cosine similarity within the entity vector database. Based on the match, the system locates the corresponding entity nodes in the knowledge graph and retrieves their associated semantic relationships. The entity attributes, semantic asso -ciations,  and  contextual  information  are  then  structured  and  processed  by  LLMs,  which integrate multiple features to generate the final answer A .  As shown in Eq. 3, the local query mechanism is formally represented as follows:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

where E Q is the embedding vector of the query Q , and E e is the embedding vector of entity E . topk refers to selecting the topk most relevant entities. G denotes the knowledge graph, f search is the search operation, concat represents the concatenation of query and retrieved content, and f LLMs is the LLM-based response generation function.

Global Query: Mapping-Reduction Architecture for Knowledge Retrieval

Mapping Stage: This stage evaluates the semantic relevance between the query Q and various communities { C i } n i =1 in the knowledge graph. As shown in Eq. 4 , the specific process involves providing a question Q and a set of communities { C i } n i =1 , and using promptbased LLMs to compute the semantic relevance score S i between Q and each community C i :

The process includes: (I) segmenting standardized text into blocks; (II) extracting entities and relations using large language models; (III) building the knowledge graph for hydraulic engineer -ing operation and maintenance; and (IV) detecting semantic communities and generating corresponding summaries

where f map is the semantic relevance scoring function powered by LLMs. S i denotes the matching degree between the query and community C i .

Reduction Stage: Core entities and related knowledge are extracted and integrated from highly relevant communities. Through collaborative reasoning, The final answer is generated. As shown in Eq. 5, a relevance threshold θ is set to select the high-relevance community set C ∗ that satisfies S i ≥ θ :

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

Then, knowledge fusion and collaborative reasoning are performed to generate the final answer A , as shown in Eq. 6:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

where f reduce represents the reasoning function that integrates retrieved entities and rela -tionships using LLMs.

This Mapping-Reduction paradigm enables cross-community knowledge selection and integration at a global scale, overcoming the limitations of single-community boundaries. As a result, it facilitates the generation of more comprehensive and in-depth responses.

## 3  Experiments

## 3.1  Evaluation Metrics

To validate the performance of the fine-tuned LLaVA model and GraphRAG technology in hydraulic engineering inspection tasks, this study selects Precision (P), Recall (R), and F1-score (F1) as the key evaluation metrics. The corresponding formulas are presented in Eqs. 7 -9:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

Where True Positive (TP) denotes the number of correctly identified positive samples by the model; False Positive (FP) represents the number of samples incorrectly identified as positive; and False Negative (FN) indicates the number of positive samples that the model failed to identify.

Given the complexity of evaluating the multi-agent framework, this study compares the inspection reports generated by the framework with historical human reports to validate its applicability and technological advantages in hydraulic engineering operations.

<!-- image -->

To systematically assess the quality and effectiveness of the generated reports, this study establishes a four-dimensional evaluation system based on a five-point Likert scale (Uhm et al. 2025 ).  Additionally, a paired t -test (Cheng et al. 2024) is employed to examine whether there are statistically significant differences in evaluation scores across different user groups. The four evaluation dimensions include:

- Professionalism : The extent to which the report reflects professional knowledge of hydraulic engineering operations and engineering standards.
- Relevance : The semantic consistency between the report conclusions and the problem context.
- Usefulness :  The  value  of  the  information  in  supporting  operational  decision-making and its practical applicability.
- Efficiency : The end-to-end response time from task initiation to report generation.

3. GraphRAG enhancement group: Combines vector embedding with symbolic rep -resentation. Utilizes knowledge graphs to organize and structure knowledge. Provides structured contextual information for knowledge augmentation. Experiments are con -ducted using Qwen2-7B\_Graph and DeepSeek\_R1\_Graph.

## 3.2.3  Framework Evaluation

In  this  study,  20  hydraulic  engineering  inspection  scenarios  were  selected  based  on  the opinions of experts and maintenance personnel. These scenarios cover a variety of common hydraulic engineering issues, including equipment failures, structural damage, and emer -gency response handling, representing typical working conditions in hydraulic engineering inspections. These cases were used to evaluate the professionalism, relevance, efficiency, and usefulness of the generated reports. The evaluation framework was designed to cover a multi-tiered user group (with 1 to 15 years of industry experience). A dual-track verification  mechanism, involving both domain experts and maintenance teams, was adopted to ensure the reliability of results: Domain experts provided structured scoring based on technical standards. Maintenance teams conducted utility validation based on actual work -flows.  Using Kappa consistency testing (K = 0.82), the evaluation system demonstrated both objectivity and engineering guidance value, effectively supporting the iterative optimization of the system.

## 4.1.1  Data Collection and Processing

To systematically evaluate the performance improvement of domain-adaptive fine-tuning on the multimodal model, this study selected flight inspection weekly reports related to the operation and management quality issues of the South-to-North Water Diversion Project from the past three years as the data source. A total of 136 standardized inspection documents were collected. During the feature extraction stage, regular expressions and OpenCV were jointly employed to cover six categories of engineering maintenance defects, including channel engineering issues and facility equipment problems. In the data cleaning process, semantic compression was performed based on the ChatGLM-6B model to remove redundant  information  irrelevant  to  engineering  maintenance  defects,  such  as  locations,  time -stamps, and numeric data, ensuring the data is concise and focused. For the fine-tuning data  construction,  the  focus  was  placed  on  defects  of  equipment  and  its  components. A dialogue format simulating human-machine interaction was adopted to accurately and comprehensively reflect potential risks of the equipment, generating a high-quality image-text instruction fine-tuning dataset. Finally, a panel of five experts was assembled to validate the cleaned data, resulting in 7,596 training samples, 1,889 validation samples, and 1,889 test samples.

## 4.1.2  Performance Evaluation

This study evaluates the performance of five models (LLaVA, fine-tuned LLaVA, GPT-4o, Gemini 1.5 Pro, and Yi-VL) on a test set of 1,889 samples, using precision (P), recall (R), and F1-score (F1) as evaluation metrics, as shown in Table 5.

Table 6 Performance improvement of GraphRAG on various models

| Model             | P     | R     | F1    |
|-------------------|-------|-------|-------|
| Qwen2_7B          | 40.5% | 47.5% | 43.7% |
| Qwen2_7B-naive    | 51.3% | 62.6% | 56.4% |
| Qwen2_7B-Graph    | 63.2% | 67.9% | 65.5% |
| DeepSeek_R1       | 72.5% | 68.0% | 70.2% |
| DeepSeek_R1-naive | 78.9% | 78.7% | 78.8% |
| DeepSeek_R1-Graph | 81.5% | 90.8% | 85.9% |

Experimental results indicate that the fine-tuned LLaVA model achieves an F1-score of 80.3% for equipment identification and 82.5% for engineering maintenance defect recog -nition, ranking second only to GPT-4o. Compared to the non-fine-tuned LLaVA, the finetuned version improves the F1-score by 7.2% for equipment identification and 6.9% for defect recognition.

These  findings  demonstrate  that  LoRA  fine-tuning  significantly  enhances  LLaVA's adaptability to hydraulic engineering inspection scenarios. Specifically, LoRA updates the original weight matrix W 0 in the attention layers and multimodal mapping layers, as shown in Eq. 10 :

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

where B ∈ R d × r and A ∈ R r × k are low-rank matrices with rank r /lessmuch min( d, k ) . This lowrank adaptation effectively adjusts model parameters while keeping most of the original weights frozen,  thereby  improving  the  model's  ability  to  recognize  both  equipment  and engineering maintenance defects.

The technique not only improves model performance in domain-specific tasks but also broadens  the  potential  applications  of  multimodal  large  language  models  in  specialized fields such as hydraulic engineering.

## 4.2  Impact of GraphRAG on LLM Performance

To assess the impact of GraphRAG's dynamic knowledge base on LLMs' final response generation, a dataset of 985 samples was used for evaluation, with results shown in Table 6.

For open-source models in the Qwen2 series, the base model achieved a precision of 40.5%, recall of 47.5%, and an F1-score of 43.7%. Introducing NaiveRAG significantly improved performance ( ∆ P = +10 . 8% , ∆ R = +15 . 1% , ∆ F 1 = +12 . 7% ), with a break -through in recall (62.6%). This suggests that NaiveRAG enhances domain-specific task han-

<!-- image -->

dling through knowledge retrieval. Integrating GraphRAG further strengthened knowledge representation, leading to synergistic improvements in precision (+22.7%), recall (+20.4%), and F1-score (+21.8%).

For commercial models such as DeepSeek\_R1, which already demonstrates industryleading performance (P = 72.5%, R = 68.0%, F1 = 70.2%), GraphRAG still provided notable gains. NaiveRAG improved professional domain retrieval precision by 6.4% (78.9%). GraphRAG significantly boosted recall to 90.8% (+22.8%), while optimizing retrieval efficiency and response quality (P = 81.5%, R = 90.8%, F1 = 85.9%).

Overall,  GraphRAG  effectively  enhances  model  performance,  improving  recall  and F1-score  while  maintaining  high  precision.  These  results  highlight  GraphRAG's  broad potential for improving knowledge retrieval and generation capabilities in LLMs.

## 4.3  Framework Evaluation Results

A total of 20 maintenance personnel and 10 hydraulic engineering experts evaluated the generated inspection reports across four key dimensions:

- Q1: How professional do you find the generated report?
- Q2: How relevant is the report to your work?
- Q3: How helpful is the report for your tasks?
- Q4: Does the report generation speed improve your daily workflow efficiency?

These  questions  assess  the  professionalism,  relevance,  usefulness,  and  efficiency  of  the inspection reports. Specifically:

- Professionalism evaluates the extent of domain-specific knowledge in hydraulic engineering embedded within the report.
- Relevance measures how well the report aligns with real-world tasks.
- Usefulness gauges the report's value in operational decision-making.
- Efficiency assesses whether automated reporting accelerates workflow.

By constructing a systematic evaluation framework across multiple dimensions, this study verifies  the  framework's overall performance and provides a clear direction for iterative optimization.

Professionalism (Q1) As shown in Fig. 7 ,  40% of experts selected "Highly Agree", indicating high recognition of the report's professionalism. Additionally, 65% of maintenance personnel chose either "Agree" or "Highly Agree", demonstrating broad acceptance from field-level stakeholders. The results of the paired t -test, as presented in Table 7, further sup -port this finding. The expert group yielded t -statistic = 2.5861, p -value = 0.0147 ( p &lt; 0 . 05 ), and the operation and maintenance personnel group showed t -statistic = 2.545, p -value = 0.0099 ( p &lt; 0 . 05 ), indicating statistically significant differences in favor of the frameworkgenerated reports over traditional manually written ones.In summary, both subjective evalu -ations and statistical significance testing validate the superior performance of the proposed framework in terms of professionalism. The generated reports comprehensively encompass critical technical components-such as defect descriptions, risk classifications, and mainte-

higher approval than experts.According to the paired t -test results presented in Table 7, The expert  group  showed t -statistic = 2 . 3265 , p -value = 0 . 0225 ( p &lt; 0 . 05 ),  and  the  opera -tion  and  maintenance  personnel  group  yielded t -statistic = 2 . 2078 , p -value = 0 . 0199 ( p &lt; 0 . 05 ). These results confirm that the framework-generated reports exhibit a statistically significant advantage in terms of alignment between report content and task context, compared to traditional manually written reports.The observed strength in relevance is primarily attributed to the integration of a dynamic context-awareness mechanism, which enables the model to effectively capture the semantic characteristics of maintenance tasks. By adjusting the report content accordingly, the framework demonstrates enhanced scenario adaptability and contextual accuracy, particularly in sections such as case-specific recommendations and resource planning. This significantly improves the practical value of the generated reports.

Usefulness (Q3) As shown in Fig. 9, 70% of experts and 60% of maintenance personnel selected 'Agree' or 'Highly Agree,' reflecting a strong consensus between both groups on the usefulness of the framework-generated reports.As presented in Table 7, the paired t -test  results  further  verify  this  finding:The  expert  group  showed t -statistic = 2 . 4495 , p -value = 0 . 0184 ( p &lt; 0 . 05 ), while the operation and maintenance personnel group exhib -ited t -statistic = 2 . 3714 , p -value = 0 . 0142 ( p &lt; 0 . 05 ),  confirming  the  statistically  significant advantage of the proposed framework in enhancing report utility.Specifically, the structured outputs generated by the framework provide actionable guidance for critical pro -cesses such as emergency plan formulation and routine maintenance management. The high level of agreement between expert and user evaluations highlights the practical utility of the  generated  reports  in  facilitating  operational  decision-making  for  the  maintenance  of hydraulic engineering.

Efficiency  (Q4) As  shown  in  Fig.  10 ,  40%  of  experts  and  55%  of  maintenance  per -sonnel  selected  'Highly  Agree,'  indicating  a  strong  endorsement  from  both  groups regarding  the  framework's  rapid  response  capabilities,  with  experts  demonstrating  particularly  high  recognition.As  indicated  in  Table 7,  the  paired t -test  results  show  significant differences favoring the framework: The expert group reported a t -statistic of 4.7143 ( p -value = 0 . 0005 &lt; 0 . 05 ),  while  the  operation  and  maintenance  personnel  group  had  a t -statistic of 4.0978 ( p -value = 0 . 0003 &lt; 0 . 05 ). These results confirm that the efficiency of reports generated by the proposed framework is significantly higher than that of manually written reports.Combining subjective evaluations with statistical significance analysis, It

can be concluded that the proposed framework significantly shortens the end-to-end process cycle while maintaining high report quality, thereby providing strong technical support for the efficient execution of operation and maintenance tasks in hydraulic engineering.

Overall, the comprehensive evaluation validates the technical advantages of the proposed framework in enhancing the intelligence level of maintenance operations in hydraulic engi -neering. Future research will focus on optimizing multimodal data processing mechanisms, strengthening knowledge reasoning capabilities in complex scenarios, and establishing a dynamic  feedback-driven  model  iteration  system  to  continuously  improve  the  system's engineering applicability and domain universality.

## 5  Discussion

Although the dataset constructed in this study exhibits certain advantages in terms of scale and domain expertise, several limitations remain (Hao et al. 2024 ). First, sampling bias is present because the data predominantly originate from the South-to-North Water Diversion Project. Consequently, samples related to facility equipment faults and automated devices are somewhat overrepresented, whereas representative samples from other categories, such as cross-building issues and channel engineering, are relatively scarce. Second, the diversity of the data requires improvement. Most existing image samples were collected during day -time under clear weather conditions, with a lack of data from more complex meteorologi -cal scenarios such as nighttime or rainy and cloudy weather, which constrains the model's adaptability in extreme environments. Lastly, a minor portion of the data contains noise; some images suffer from blurriness or occlusion, reducing their clarity and overall usability. To address these challenges, future work will focus on expanding the dataset's coverage, enriching the variety and diversity of samples, and incorporating data augmentation techniques as well as multimodal generative models to synthesize high-quality synthetic samples (Qu et al. 2024; Zhao et al. 2025 ). These efforts aim to enhance the model's generalization capability and robustness under complex environmental conditions.

Furthermore,  the  proposed  intelligent  operation  and  maintenance  framework  demonstrates  strong  scalability  and  generalizability.  Designed  with  a  modular  architecture  and

<!-- image -->

empowered by knowledge-enhanced reasoning mechanisms, the framework allows flexible adaptation across diverse hydraulic engineering projects and other types of infrastructure systems. Users can achieve customized deployment and rapid system migration by simply adjusting workflows and data configurations to meet specific application requirements. For instance,  by  replacing  the  domain-specific  knowledge  graph,  fine-tuning  input  data,  and customizing  irrigation-related  workflows,  the  framework  can  be  seamlessly  extended  to support intelligent irrigation management. Looking ahead, efficient deployment and broad applicability  can  be  realized  through  targeted  adjustments  to  model  parameters,  knowledge graph content, and business logic. This not only facilitates the widespread adoption of intelligent operation and maintenance technologies but also promotes their implementa -tion across various infrastructure domains. Meanwhile, this study establishes a technical paradigm for constructing transferable and adaptive general-purpose infrastructure systems, which can serve as a valuable reference for advancing research in related domains, such as sustainable development and spatial justice (Ghalehteimouri et al. 2021 ).

Finally, as artificial intelligence systems become increasingly integrated into the operation and maintenance of hydraulic engineering projects, their potential ethical and social impacts are drawing growing attention. Models may inherit biases from historical data dur -ing  training,  which  can  result  in  misjudgments  during  real-world  decision-making. This necessitates  enhanced  data  preprocessing  procedures,  including  rigorous  data  screening, ongoing bias detection and correction, and the involvement of multi-disciplinary experts in model evaluation to improve the transparency and interpretability of system decisions. Meanwhile, the automation of operation and maintenance tasks may lead to the reduction of certain basic jobs. To mitigate employment-related impacts, it is essential to simultaneously promote skill upgrading, job transitions, and mechanisms for human-machine collaboration, thereby fostering both improved efficiency and workforce development. On the data front, areas densely covered by sensors and image acquisition devices may raise privacy concerns. This requires the strict implementation of data anonymization, access control, and encrypted storage strategies. Where necessary, privatized system deployment can further ensure data security and regulatory compliance (Timofte et al. 2024). In future deployments and research practices, continued emphasis on the integration of explainable AI (Maußner et al. 2025 ), fairness-aware learning mechanisms, and privacy-preserving technologies will be crucial to ensuring the safety, accountability, and sustainable development of intelligent systems in the water conservancy sector.

## 6  Conclusion and Future Work

This study addresses key challenges in intelligent water conservancy engineering opera -tions, including knowledge fragmentation, decision-making delays, and model hallucination, by innovatively constructing a multi-agent collaborative decision-making framework enhanced with multimodal knowledge. A dual knowledge enhancement mechanism is proposed, integrating domain-adaptive fine-tuning and dynamic knowledge base augmentation. Through LoRA-based efficient fine-tuning, the performance of multimodal large models in equipment identification  and  engineering  maintenance  defect  detection  has  been  significantly improved, with F1-scores increasing by 7.2% and 6.9%, respectively. Meanwhile, the introduction of dynamic knowledge graph construction effectively reduces the model

1 3

hallucination rate.Compared to traditional RAG methods, GraphRAG employs a hierarchical  retrieval  mechanism based on the mapping-reduction paradigm, utilizing community detection and semantic relevance calculations to enable cross-domain reasoning. This leads to a significant improvement in F1-scores for complex query scenarios, validating the effectiveness  of  structured  knowledge  representation  in  enhancing  domain-specific  tasks.The proposed modular architecture, comprising perception, cognition, and decision, enables a closed-loop management system from data collection to maintenance verification.

Future research will be carried out in the following three directions:

1. Edge intelligence: Develop lightweight edge computing modules to achieve real-time collaboration among drones, inspection robots, and central systems.
2. Knowledge  evolution: Build  an  incremental  knowledge  evolution  mechanism  to dynamically update the knowledge graph through online learning.
3. Federated learning: Explore cross-basin knowledge sharing under the federated learning paradigm to overcome data silo constraints and enhance model generalization.

The engineering application of this framework will promote the transformation of hydraulic engineering operation and maintenance from experience-driven to knowledge-driven. Furthermore, the methodology provides a transferable technical framework applicable to the intelligent operation and maintenance of other infrastructure sectors, such as transportation and energy.
